                    <p class="lead">
                        The Jennifer Kressaty Nursing Symposium was made possible by a donation to the Banner Health
                        Foundation by John and Kim Kressaty, and honors the legacy of their daugher, Jennifer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jennifer was diagnosed with a heart murmur at the age of 24, and succumbed to sudden cardiac
                        death in 1997. The Kressaty family later learned that the congenital valve disease she had was
                        the same as her father's.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two years after Jennifer's passing, John was diagnosed with acute heart failure and placed on the
                        heart transplant waiting list. In 2001, doctors at Banner Heart Hospital treated him while nurses
                        worked to keep him stable while waiting for transplant. Thankful for the care he received, John
                        pledged to become a volunteer. His plans were quickly delayed, as one month later he underwent a
                        heart transplant at what is now Banner University Medical Center Tucson.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nine months after transplant, John fulfilled his promise to the nurses who, in his own words,
                        "kept him alive until a heart was available." He became an active volunteer at multiple Banner
                        facilities in Arizona. In 2013, John became the first volunteer to receive Banner Heart's
                        prestigious Guardian Award, recognizing his wisdom, warmth, strength, integrity, and gentleness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While volunteering was a rewarding opportunity to express his gratitude, John felt there was
                        still more to be done. John and Kim worked with the Banner Health Foundation to unveil the
                        Jennifer A. Kressaty Scholarship Fund to honor the memory of their daughter. This Foundation
                        fund supports educational programs that help Banner nurses further their professional development
                        and training, ultimately enriching the care they provide to Banner patients.
